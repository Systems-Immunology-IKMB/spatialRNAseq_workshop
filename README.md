# Welcome to KLS Summer School Workshop on Spatial RNA-seq

Spatial transcriptomics is a technique that measures gene expression in a tissue while preserving the spatial location of each measurement, allowing researchers to see where specific genes are active within the tissue.

In this workshop we will cover key steps in the analysis workflow, including quality control, preprocessing, clustering and visualization, cluster annotation, spatial clustering, and integration with single-cell transcriptomics data.

# Loading the dataset
Go to https://www.10xgenomics.com/datasets/visium-hd-cytassist-gene-expression-libraries-of-mouse-intestine and download the dataset: Intestine mice (swiss-roll) as batch.
In this session, we focus on the 8 µm bins and do not need load the 16 µm bins.

The above code was adapted from a more completed code use in NGS-CN 'Summer school of Spatial Transcriptomics'. The input of Katrin Sameith and Andreas Petzold cannot be overstated.
